Cordova Example - Get To Know : Global Voices
=============================================

I worked on the beginner functionality. I added:

1) an alert on error for the ajax requests, and 
2) changed the styling of the app to include a status bar using the status bar plugin: 
https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-statusbar/blob/master/doc/index.md#configxml

This was just a preliminary round to get something turned in before class dec 10th- I'm really interested in creating something with the geolocation plugin, which I started to read about.  Check back later this week for more updates!
