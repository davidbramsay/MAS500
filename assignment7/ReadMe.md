This is an alteration of the Election Data example.

I pulled average latitute and longitude data for every state and put it in a CSV.

I then drew circles centered at the lat/lon of each state, with the size of the circle representing the
total number of people who voted in that state, and with the color (red or blue) representing who won.  The shade of 
the color is subtlely mapped to the percentage they won with.
